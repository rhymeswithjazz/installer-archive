We all know and love Veritasium and MKBHD, but I want to hear about all the ones that deserve just as much shine. YouTube, podcast, Instagram, take your pick — if they’re tech-y and Verge-ish, great, but if not, that’s great, too! Hit me with one or two of your faves that you bet most of us don’t know. I’ll share some of my faves, too.",
